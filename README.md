# belly-button-challenge
assignment 14
In this assignment, we built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site('https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json'), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

For interactive visualisation we have used d3 and Plotly. To create dynamic website layout we have used bootstrap
